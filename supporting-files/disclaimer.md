# Disclaimer

First of all; thank you for using our app! It has been built with <3 and is open-sourced for mainly two reasons: we are happy to accept any contributions and to show there is nothing to hide in the code.

In the past, during the first version of this app there was some feedback that users didn't trust it. Now, everyone can see what is going on and even help make it better!

Having said this, it is important to realize that we (the developers and contributors of this app) cannot be held responsible for any misuse in any way. We merely tried to create a tool to help raise awareness for digital security and help you to check if any of your personal details are leaked.

## Have I Been Pwned data
The data used in this app comes directly from the [haveibeenpwned.com](https://haveibeenpwned.com) by [Troy Hunt](https://troyhunt.com). He is doing a terrific job indexing all kinds of hacks all over the world, stripping the personal details and makes the bare data available for us to check if we were part of the hack.

He or us are in no way responsible for any of this data or its origin. We cannot remove your data nor will there be any garantuee that your data is completely removed from the web when we would.

Last but not least: think before you enter data into this app or haveibeenpwned.com. While you may control your device, you cannot always control the network. It's like the Google Chrome Icognito mode: we cannot protect your from people looking over your shoulder, etc.
